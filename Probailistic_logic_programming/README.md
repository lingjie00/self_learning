# Probabilistic logic programming

The inspiration to explore this topic arise as I chance upon
[Raymond (1992) Probabilistic logic
programming.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089054019290061J)

It is interesting to investigate how to apply formal logic
on probabilistic semantic. 

Reading the paper requires some time, I watched a [Short
introduction to probabilistic logic programming by Angelika
Kimmig.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g0Z5b77rOs&ab_channel=PROBPROGConference)
The notes I make is available [here](./short_intro_to_angelika_kimmig_yt.md)

## Abstract of Raymond (1992)

> Of all scientific investigations into reasoning with
> uncertainty and chance, probability theory is perhaps the
> best understood paradigm. Nevertheless, all studies
> conducted thus far into the semantics of quantitative
> logic programming have restricted themselves to
> non-probabilistic semantic characterizations. In this
> paper, we take a few steps towards rectifying this
> situation. We define a logic programming language that is
> syntactically similar to the annotated logics of Blair et
> al., 1987, Blair and Subrahmanian, 1988, 45–73) but in
> which the truth values are interpreted probabilistically.
> A probabilistic model theory and fixpoint theory is
> developed for such programs. This probabilistic model
> theory satisfies the requirements proposed by Fenstad (in
> “Studies in Inductive Logic and Probabilities” (R. C.
> Jeffrey, Ed.), Vol. 2, pp. 251–262, Univ. of California
> Press, Berkeley, 1980) for a function to be called
> probabilistic. The logical treatment of probabilities is
> complicated by two facts: first, that the connectives
> cannot be interpreted truth-functionally when truth values
> are regarded as probabilities; second, that negation-free
> definite-clause-like sentences can be inconsistent when
> interpreted probabilistically. We address these issues
> here and propose a formalism for probabilistic reasoning
> in logic programming. To our knowledge, this is the first
> probabilistic characterization of logic programming
> semantics.
