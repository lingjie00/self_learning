# Self Learning

My formal education is in economics and statistics. However,
my interest is wider than my formal education, and I'm
grateful for being able to expand my knowledge both in width
and depth with all the online learning resources available
today.

I used to store my study notes in various places, but I find
them messy and hard to keep track after a while. Therefore,
I decided to create this repo as a centralized location for
all the non-formal education learning content.

This repo is structured as such:

- `archive` folder contains
some older learning materials I have, but is badly
organized.

- Each of the folder will contain a topic/course I
learned. I will include my notes, codes and other related
materials. Each folder will have its own README to
elaborate on the relevant resources.

- Each topic/course will have its own branch until I'm done
  with the material.
