# Deployment

Challenges: (1) statistical issues (2) software issues

- Concept drift and Data drift
  - Concept drift: x $\rightarrow$ y
  - Data drift: $x$
  - Another example: Speech recognition
    - Training set: purchased data, historical data
    - Test set: few months ago data (recency)
    - Question: has data changed over time? Due to changes
      in languages, mic?
  - Type of changes:
    - Gradual changes: e.g. vocab changes over time
    - Sudden shock: e.g. COVID changes purchase behaviour
      drastically such as credit card

- Software engineering issues
  - Implementation checklist
    - Real-time or Batch? E.g. how slow can you afford for
      inference
    - Cloud vs Edge/Browser? E.g. even when internet is
      disconnected the model can continue to function
    - Compute resources (CPU/GPU/memory)? E.g. How much
      resource do you want at prediction service?
    - Latency, throughout (QPS, query per second)? E.g.
      Speech has a longest latency requirement of 500ms
    - Logging? E.g. logging data, experiment for re-training
      and debugging
    - Security and privacy?

Task: (1) first deployment: writing software to deploy
(2) maintenance: update model when concept/data drift happened 

## Deployment patterns

Common deployment cases

- New product/capability
  - Start small amount of traffic then drive up
- Automate/assist with manual task
  - E.g. built on existing manual inspection
- Replace previous ML system

Key ideas:

1. Gradual ramp up with monitoring
    - Instead of spending massive traffic at the start, send
      small traffic then built up
2. Rollback
   - In the event the deployment failed

Type of deployment

- Shadow mode deployment
  - ML system shadows the human and runs in parallel
  - ML system's output not used for any decisions during
    this phase
  - Ensure to gather learning data to compare against the
    human decision, and based on the data decide if ML algo
    can replace human
- Canary deployment
  - Roll out to small fraction (e.g. 5%) of traffic
    initially
  - Monitor system and ramp up traffic gradually
- Blue green deployment
  - Old: blue version, New: green version
  - Have router send data to blue version, when switching
    send the data to green version
  - Advantage: easy way to enable rollback using the router
    to re-route to the blue version
  - You can use more gradual switching as well

Degrees of automation

- Not a 0 or 1, but a degree of automation
- Human only > Shadow mode > AI assistance > Partial
  automation (only accept subset of results, e.g. do not
  accept a confident prediction) > Full automation
- You can choose to stop in any stages and does not have to
  go full automation
  - Human in the loop: AI assistance, Partial automation
  - Full AI: massive data e.g. consumer search, that is
    impossible to have human in the loop

## Monitoring

- Monitoring dashboard
  - Server load
  - Fraction of non-null outputs
  - Fraction of missing input values
  - Brainstorm the things that could go wrong, and
    brainstorm a few statistics/metrics that will detect
    that problem
  - It's okay to start with many metrics initially and
    gradually remove metrics not useful
  - Software metrics: memory, compute, latency, throughput,
    server load
  - Input metrics (X): average input length, average input
    volume, number of missing values, average image
    brightness
  - Output metrics (y): # times return null, # times
    user redoes search, # times user switches to typing, CTR
  - Set a threshold to alarm the team to investigate for
    issues
- Deployment is iterative process
  - model: ML model/data -> error analysis -> Experiement
  - deployment: deployment/monitoring -> traffic ->
    performance analysis
  - Iterative process is required to choose the right set of
    metrics to monitor
  - Adapt metrics and threshold over time
- Model maintenance
  - Manual re-training (more common now)
  - Automatic re-training

## Pipeline monitoring

Multiple steps in a machine learning pipeline.

- An example: speech recognition
  - Audio -> VAD (voice activity detection module, observe if
    anyone is speaking) -> Speech recognition -> Transcript
  - VAD controls the amount of data transfer to server to
    ease server load
  - Changes to VAD will affect the speech recognition as
    well
- An example: user profile
  - User data (e.g. clickstream) -> user profile (e.g. own
    car? Y N unknown) -> recommender system -> product
    recommendations
  - If clickstream data changes, user profile (if user owns
    a car) changes, producing more unknowns, will affect the
    recommendations

Useful move:

- monitor metrics
- how quickly do the data change?
  - User data generally has slower drift
      - e.g. appearance don't change too fast, e.g. hairstyle changes
      - But events such as COVID-19, or holiday will result
        in sudden change in user data
  - Enterprise data (B2B) can shift fast
      - e.g. manufacturing might change very fast e.g. new
        machine
